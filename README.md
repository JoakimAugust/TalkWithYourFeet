# TalkWithYourFeet
 A multiplayer game with a special interface for communication.

 This game was made with the purpose of testing if a feet controlled communication interface could be implemented in a real-time multiplayer game.
 The game itself is made in Unreal Engine, version 4.16.3. In its current state itâ€™s only playable in LAN mode, with 2-8 players on two different teams.
 The controls for the communication interface is bounded to the arrow buttons. This makes it easy to use an external interface, like a Makey Makey, to control the interface.
